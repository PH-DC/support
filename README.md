### Ideas of how we could turn this into a support channel.

Imagine a scenario where you are helping or a friend or a new friend, or a colleague on Discord / MS Teams / Slack, etc. They may have found an old article with source code from 5+ years ago about an Android App  that is not supported, a Node.js article that isn't supported in Node v14 and that sort of thing...

You volunteer to help that person, you pair on it, it's fixed and they're super happy.
